<h1>PROJECT: DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS</h1>

<p>The project comprises of two assignments that dwelve into the topics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure">data structures and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a>.

<p>The first assignment covers the topic of searching binary trees. Binary search trees functions where data is group together and returns a tree full of nodes where each left node is "lower" than each right node. The tree initiates with the "root node" and any node with no children is called a "leaf node". In the file binary_tree.rb, a simple binary tree structure is to be constructed from some arbitrary input and the "crawler" function will locate data inside of it.</p>

<p>On second assignment titled knight_moves.rb, a function knight_moves illustrates the simplest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all square possibilities the knight will stop along the way.</p>
